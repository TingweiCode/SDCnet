SDCnet Network Package
===========================
This Package can auto-extract dispersion from FTAN diagram.

All codes
1-train_syn.py, running the code for the main program
2-prediction_ak135_SDCnet.py, synthetic test for AK135 dispersion curves
2-prediction_syn_SDCnet.py, synthetic test for 3D synthetic data extract dispersion curves
2-prediction_obs_SDCnet.py, Implementation of extract dispersion curves for observed data.
2-prediction_obs_Unet.py, Implementation SDCnet of extract dispersion curves for observed data
3-plot_loss_obs_Unet_and_SDCnet.py, Plot SDCnet and Unet loss

All code can be run on computer server with four Nvidia GEFORCE RTX 2080Ti in Ubuntu 18.04.4 environment.
